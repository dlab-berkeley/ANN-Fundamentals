    "We talked about the basics of Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and gave an intuitive summary and example in the slides. Hope you already get a sense of how ANN works.

    "Let's start with the simple type of Artificial Neural Network - [Perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron), which developed back to the late 1950s; its first implementation, in custom hardware, was one of the first artificial neural networks to be produced. You can also treat it as a two layer neural network without the hidden layers. Even though it has limitations, it contains most of the parts we want to cover for the ANN.   \n",

The target of the data is simply 0 or 1 for two different classes, i.e. class 0, and class 1. We want to build and train a simple Perceptron model that can output the correct target by feeding into the 3 features from the data samples. See the following table.

    "\n",
    "We can see from the figure that we have two layers in this model: the input layer and the output layer. For the input layer, it has 3 features that connect to the output layer via 3 weights. Also we added one more node with 1 as input, and the weight associated with it is the $\\omega_0$, we will talk more of this term next. The steps we will take to train this model is:\n",
    "1. Initialize the weights to small random numbers with both positive or negative values.\n",
    "2. For many iterations:  \n",
    "       Calculate the output value based on all data samples.\n",
    "       Update the weights based on the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we look at the code how to implement this, we need go through some concepts:  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Bias term\n",
    "Now let's look at the extra 1 we added to the input layer. It is connected to the output layer by weight $\\omega_0$. Why we add 1 to the input? Think about the case if all our features are 0, and no matter what weights we have, we will always have 0 to the output layer. Therefore, adding this 1 extra node can avoid this problem. It is usually called bias term.   \n",
    "\n",
    "### Activation function   \n",
    "The output layer only has one node, that sum all the passed input and determine whether the output should fire or not (this is ANN terminology related with the brain, when we have enough signal at the neurons, they will fire a signal, the threshold can be different). Usually we use 1 indicate fire and 0 indicate not fire. In this case, we can see the sum of all the input via the weights are: z = $1*\\omega_0 + feature1*\\omega_1 + feature2*\\omega_2 + feature3*\\omega_3$. But what we want as the output is either 0 or 1 to represent two classes, or a number between 0 and 1, so that we can use it as a probability. Since this number z can be anything, how can we scale it to a value within 0 to 1, as a probability, or simply 0 and 1? Here, the [activation function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_function) comes to help. The purpose of using the activation function is to  achieve this goal. Therefore, we can choose many different activation function, but the most commonly used activation function is the sigmoid (also called logistic) function, which is shown below, to scale the value z to a number between 0 and 1 to represent probability. The advantage of using this function lies in its ability to get the derivative. Since the derivative will be used to update the weights during learning, this property from the sigmoid function is very desirable. The horizontal axis is the z value from the above, it can be any value from negative to positive. The vertical axis is the scaled value from 0 to 1 that we can use as our output. We can see that, if the z value we get is a large positive number, say 10, or a very small negative number, i.e. -10, the scaled value will be either 1 or 0. We can say at these cases, the network is very confident that the class is belong to certain class. But if we have z relatively close to 0, for example, -1 to 1, then the scaled value will be around 0.2 to 0.7, which also indicates the network is not so confident about the result. \n",

    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qingkaikong/blog/master/39_ANN_part2_step_by_step/figures/figure2_sigmoid.jpg\" width=\"600\"/>   \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, by input the features to the network, and we can get the perceptron network to classify an object into two different class. But what if the result is wrong by input the features? This is totally possible, since we initialize the weights as random small numbers. To solve this problem, we need the perceptron to have the ability to learn from the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How to learn from error  \n",
    "\n",
    "Learning will be achieved by first estimate how much error we make by using current weights, and then find some way to update the weights that we can reduce the error in the next time. I won't say too much here, but we will see more details with the explanation of the following code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning rate   \n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, we also need a learning rate to control how fast the network learns. We will see later in the code that the learning rate decide how much to change the weight by. We could miss it out, which would be the same as setting it to 1. But if we do that, the weights change a lot whenever there is a wrong answer, which tends to make the network unstable, so that it never settles down. The cost of having a small learning rate is that the weights need to see the inputs more often before they change significantly, so that the network takes longer to learn. However, it will be more stable and resistant to noise (errors) and inaccuracies in the data. \n",

    "The second term is the error we made. Let's think this error a little more: we have two class, class 0 and class 1. Therefore, we can have two type of error, true class is 0, but our estimation is larger than 0, the other case is true class is 1, but our estimation is less than 1. The error will be a negative number for the first case, but a positive number for the second. If we assume all the input node is positive, and we get an error as negative number, then we want to reduce the weight to make next estimation smaller. Same thing for the other case, if we have the error as a positive number, then we will want to increase the weights, so that in the next iteration, our estimation will be larger. This is the purpose we include the error term here to determine how we change the weights. But wait, what if the input nodes contain negative input? This will switch the values over, and reverse the direction we want to change the weights. How can we avoid this case? Well, it is quite simple, we can just multiply the input into this function, the negative error with negative input multiply will be a positive number, which satisfy our need. This is where line 42 comes in, we separate these two lines for more clear explanation.    \n",
    "\n",
    "The final term is the derivative of the sigmoid function evaluated at the output value. We can see a simple plot of the sigmoid function and it's derivatives at different places. The derivative at x is the slope of the sigmoid curve at value x. We can clearly see the slope is different at various value x, ranging from 0 (when x value is approaching to two end, i.e. either really large or really small, you can also see the slope is very flat) to 1 (when x value is close to the 0, the slope is very steep). This means we will multiply another value that is between 0 to 1 to the error we made that already scaled with the learning rate. If we look carefully with the figure, the slope of the green and purple dots are flat than the blue dot, which means they will have a smaller value. The green and purple dots represent more confidence of the result to be one class, for example, the green dot the sigmoid value is about 0.9, which is much close to the class 1. But the blue dot has a sigmoid value 0.5, which we have no idea whether it should belong to class 1 or class 0. Therefore, this slope is large when we have no confidence of determine the class of result, and small when we have more confidence of the class of the results. Now, this makes sense, if the current weights already made a very good estimate of the class (for the green dot), we will want to update the weights really small or even not update it. But if the current estimation is not clear, for example, the blue case, we will want to change the weights relatively large to make it clearer. Therefore, combining the 3 terms, we can get a delta value for each of the weight we want to change in the direction to reduce the error.    \n",
